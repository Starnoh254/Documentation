## 📘 The 4 Laws of Atomic Habits + Real Examples

### ⚡ 1. Make It Obvious
Create a clear cue for the habit — remove friction to starting.

**How to do it:**
- **Environment design**:  
  - Set DSA tab (like LeetCode) as a browser homepage.  
  - Sticky note: _“1 DSA problem before lunch!”_
- **Habit stacking**:  
  - “After breakfast → 1 calculus video”  
  - “After brushing teeth → Check stock market app”

**Examples:**
- DSA: _Every day after lunch, I solve 1 LeetCode problem._
- Calculus: _Watch 1 Khan Academy video after breakfast._
- Investing: _Check portfolio after dinner._

### 💎 2. Make It Attractive
Tempt your brain to want the habit.

**How to do it:**
- **Temptation bundling**:  
  - Only listen to music while solving DSA  
  - Reward after tasks (YouTube, games, snacks)
- **Join a tribe**:  
  - Reddit, Discord, or Telegram groups for your interests.

**Examples:**
- DSA: _Solve while vibing to music_
- Calculus: _Watch while sipping tea_
- Investing: _Join Telegram group for stock discussions_

### 💪 3. Make It Easy
Reduce resistance. Start **small**. Aim for **consistency**, not intensity.

**How to do it:**
- **2-minute rule**: _Start small, e.g., 1 problem or 1 video_  
- **Prepare the path**:  
  - Bookmark DSA sites  
  - Open your IDE  
  - Have notebooks ready

**Examples:**
- DSA: _Solve 1 easy problem daily_
- Calculus: _1 short video per day_
- Investing: _Just observe charts — no pressure to act_

---

### 🧠 4. Make It Satisfying
Reward your brain. Make progress feel good.

**How to do it:**
- **Habit tracker**:  
  - Use calendar, Notion, Google Sheets, or a bullet journal.
- **Reward**:  
  - Snacks, media breaks, or a small celebration.
- **Visual proof**:  
  - Watch your GitHub go green  
  - See your investment portfolio grow  
  - Move tasks to “Done” in Trello

**Examples:**
- DSA: _Track progress on GitHub or calendar_
- Calculus: _Trello board for topics_
- Investing: _Write a short journal entry_

## 🚀 Quick Summary Table

| Law           | Application |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Obvious**    | Open LeetCode after breakfast |
| **Attractive** | Music + solving problems |
| **Easy**       | 1 easy problem per day |
| **Satisfying** | Habit tracker / green GitHub squares |

## 🧠 Identity-Based Habits

Your goal isn’t the habit. It’s who you become.

> “I’m a software engineer who solves problems daily.”  
> “I’m a mathematician in training.”  
> “I’m someone who’s financially smart.”

Habits reinforce identity. Identity drives habits. 🌱
