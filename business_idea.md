# 🧠 Business Idea: Shop Management System

## 📝 Problem Observation

Many small business owners in Kenya (and beyond) use **notebooks** to:
- Track **debts** from customers
- Record **sales**, **expenses**, and **stock**
- Review business performance

This is **manual**, **slow**, **prone to errors**, and if the book is lost — everything is gone.

## 💡 Core Idea

Create a **website/app** that:
- Tracks **debts and customers**
- Sends **automatic SMS reminders** to customers who haven’t paid
- Shows a **dashboard with sales reports**
- Solves real problems for real shop owners
- Is **monetizable** and **scalable**
