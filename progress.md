# SaaS Journey Log – Solving Real Problems for Small Businesses in Kenya

## ✅ Project Vision

You're building a SaaS that:
- Tracks customer **debts** for small shop owners
- Sends **SMS reminders** to customers
- Helps shop owners **digitize** their day-to-day records
- Aims to save time and reduce errors from manual bookkeeping

You're starting with a **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** and plan to:
1. Launch quickly
2. Observe usage
3. Iterate based on feedback
4. Monetize with automated payments if users find value

---

## 💡 Common Problems Small Kenyan Shops Face

These are all **opportunities** for features you can build (and later monetize):

### 1. 🧾 Manual Transaction Records
**Problem:** Sales are written in books  
**Solution:** Add a digital transaction logger  
**Bonus:** Auto-send daily summaries via SMS/WhatsApp

### 2. 🧮 Stock Management
**Problem:** They don’t track stock — run out unknowingly  
**Solution:** Decrease stock count on every sale, alert when low

### 3. 📈 No Financial Reports
**Problem:** They don’t know how much they earn or lose  
**Solution:** Auto-generate weekly/monthly reports with graphs

### 4. 💸 Forgetting Debtors
**Problem:** Debtors go untracked  
**Solution:** Your current system solves this with customer debts + SMS reminders

### 5. 🧍‍♀️ Staff Misconduct
**Problem:** Employees underreport sales  
**Solution:** User accounts for staff, track who logs which sale

### 6. 💵 Expense Tracking
**Problem:** Business owners forget or don’t log expenses  
**Solution:** Add an "Add Expense" form with categories

### 7. 🕒 Shop Check-in Logs
**Problem:** Owner doesn't know when staff open/close  
**Solution:** Time log feature to check in/out daily

## 🚧 The Fear: "What If They Don’t Pay?"

You said:
> “My biggest fear is providing a solution, people use it but don’t want to pay for it.”

### Things to Keep in Mind:
- Some users won’t pay. Focus on the **few who will**.
- Show **clear value**. Instead of selling “a SaaS”, sell **saved time**, **money protection**, and **peace of mind**.
- Even if 10 users pay you **Kshs 500/month**, that’s **Kshs 5,000 recurring income** — that’s proof of concept.
- **Start small**. Get 1 paying customer → then 3 → then 10.
