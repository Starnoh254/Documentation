# ⚡ Speeding Up Software Development – The Malric Way (Inspired by Breaking Bad)

You said it best: **"Science runs the world"** — and in software, **speed + structure = power**. This guide documents the best practices, tools, and mindset shifts to produce software faster and smarter — just like Walter White refining meth.

## 🚀 Goal

> Save time, reduce thinking on repetitive tasks, and deliver features fast without sacrificing quality.

---

## 🔥 Part 1: How to FASTEN Software Production

### ✅ 1. Automate Everything
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Vercel.
- **Linting/Formatting**: ESLint + Prettier + Husky.
- **Infra as Code**: Terraform or Docker for environments.
- **Test Scripts**: Postman test collections for APIs.

---

### ✅ 2. Use Component Libraries
- Shadcn UI, Tailwind UI, Chakra, Material UI.
- Build UIs quickly without reinventing the wheel.

---

### ✅ 3. Create Your Own Template/Boilerplate
- Vite + Tailwind + TS + Routing setup.
- Custom create-* command with all essentials preconfigured.

---

### ✅ 4. Work in Slices (Vertical Features)
- Focus on MVP slices like: login → profile → cart → checkout.
- Get features live fast instead of perfecting everything upfront.

---

### ✅ 5. Build in Public or With Feedback
- Share your work early.
- Get fast feedback → iterate quicker.

---

### ✅ 6. Hot Reload + Fast Dev Tools
- Use Vite (✅), SSDs (✅), Hot Module Reload.
- Use snippets in VS Code to speed up repetitive code.

---

### ✅ 7. Time-Box Your Work
- Set focused sprints (e.g. "1 hour to build cart").
- Limit distractions during coding sessions.

---

### ✅ 8. Master Git Workflows
- Use rebase, stash, cherry-pick for powerful history control.
- Less mess = more speed.

---

### ✅ 9. Use Typed Languages (like TypeScript)
- Prevent future bugs.
- Less debugging = more feature shipping.

---

### ✅ 10. Create Solid README + Setup Scripts
```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```
- So anyone (including future you) can run the project instantly.

## 🛠️ Part 2: What Engineers Typically Do to Build Software

### 1. Plan the Project
- Define the product
- Break it into features/pages/components
- Pick the tech stack + folder structure

### 2. Code the MVP
- Build layout, nav, pages
- Connect backend (Express, DB)
- Use APIs with Axios/Fetch

### 3. Test
- Manual → then automated tests
- Prevent future breakage

### 4. Deploy
- Auto-deploy to production with GitHub + server/Vercel

### 5. Monitor
- Log errors (Sentry, LogRocket)
- Analytics for behavior (PostHog, GA)

## 💰 Does Faster Code = More Money?

Absolutely:

| Scenario                        | Result                         |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| 🚀 You ship features fast        | Clients pay faster             |
| 💡 You build side projects fast | You can monetize quicker       |
| 🔧 You reuse/automate tasks     | You do more with less effort   |

The goal isn’t just speed — it’s **intentional speed**: clean, fast, automated systems.

## 🧪 Like Walter White But For Software

> “We’re not just making code. We’re refining the formula.”

- Clean reusable components = purer code
- CI/CD & scripts = faster delivery
- MVP focus = better ROI
- SSDs + Vite = developer speed boosts

---

## ✅ Tools & Concepts Mentioned

- **Tools**: Vite, ESLint, Prettier, Husky, GitHub Actions, Postman, Docker
- **UI**: Tailwind, Shadcn, Chakra
- **Langs**: TypeScript, Node.js
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions, Railway, Vercel
- **Monitoring**: LogRocket, PostHog, Sentry
