# 🧠 My Developer Learning Journal

Welcome to my dev brain 🧠

This repository is where I document everything I learn on my journey as a software developer — from tricky configurations to random bugs, from new frameworks to deep dives into Linux, web servers, APIs, deployment and more.

## 📌 Why I Created This

I created this repo because:

- I forget things like Nginx setup, Python env configs, etc — and I got tired of asking the same questions again and again 😅
- I want a single place to **reference my learnings** quickly, like my own personal dev manual.
- Writing things down helps me **understand deeply** — and teaches future me.
- I believe sharing knowledge, even the small things, can **help other developers too**.

## ✨ Who This Is For

- Me (future me will thank current me 🙌)
- Any curious dev who stumbled here and is trying to solve the same problem
- Anyone who loves learning out loud and building in public

## 📁 Structure

The docs are organized into folders like:

- `nginx/` – How to configure Nginx for different use cases (APK downloads, React apps, etc)
- `flask/` – Setup, deployment with Gunicorn & PM2
- `react-vite/` – Deployment tips
- `linux/` – Commands, SSH tips, file permissions
- `envs/` – Python env vars, `.env` files, etc
- `bugs/` – Weird errors and how I solved them

> I update this almost daily as I learn and build more stuff.

## 📚 How to Use
